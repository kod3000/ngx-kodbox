# KodBox Service 
*(Angular Version, Optimized for Ivy Angular 17)*

KodBox primary goal is to simplify communication between components in an Angular application. By managing shared state and providing a central point for function execution and state persistence, it helps in creating a more maintainable and scalable application architecture. The service abstracts away the complexities of direct component-to-component communication and state management, allowing developers to focus on business logic and application development.

## Developer Notes :

### Origins

I initially wrote most of this code during the Angular 8 ~ 9 era. Seeking a more dynamic method for data handling, and with Observables gaining popularity, I incorporated them into the package, offering an optimal blend of features. This package is quite powerful, facilitating easy communication between components and utilizing techniques such as data persistence. If you encounter any issues, please reach out kindly. 



Take note that when using lambda functions, this feature is somewhat advanced, and it's advisable to first understand how Angular operates internally before undertaking anything too ambitious with it.
